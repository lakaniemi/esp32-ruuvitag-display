# ESP32 RuuviTag display

## Requirements

You will need an ESP32 board with MicroPython firmware installed. This project uses firmware version `1.12.0`, but other versions might work too. See [here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html) for installation instructions

The development environment was set up using [this]([https://link](https://lemariva.com/blog/2019/08/micropython-vsc-ide-intellisense)) tutorial, which helps setting up environment for VSCode using `micropy-cli` and `pymakr`. 

Based on your system, you might have to change `address` field in `pymakr.conf` in order to connect to your ESP32.
